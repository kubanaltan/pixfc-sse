PixFC-SSE TODO list:

* Investigate where to place prefetching instructions and check its 
  platform dependency
* Investigate if using static xmm intermediate buffers instead of 
  stack-allocated ones significantly improves conversion performance.
* Add support for more pixel formats:
  - VYUY, YVYU
  - planar formats (YUV420, YVU420, YUV410, YVU410)
  - packed RGB, grey and bayer formats.
* Create subdirectories to sort source files (lib, test, common, include, ...)
* Add SSE4.1 version of routines which use blending (up/down sampling for 
  instance)
* Fix latency/throughput values displayed in inlines (use only values for 
  i5 / xeon CPUs as they are the CPUs used for testing)
* Some other things I cant think of.
