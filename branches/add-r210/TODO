PixFC-SSE TODO list:

* optimise RGB24_TO_V210_NNB_LOOP_CORE
* optimise yuv_to_rgb inline (use 8-bit left shifted coefs where possible) 
* Investigate if 8-bit left-shifted coefficients can be used and whether they 
  provide acceptable results for yuv to rgb inlines
* Investigate where to place prefetching instructions and check its 
  platform dependency
* Update non-SSE conversion routines to perform resampling.
* Add support for more pixel formats:
  - VYUY, YVYU
  - planar formats (YUV410, YVU410)
  - packed RGB, grey and bayer formats.
* Improve perf by distributing conversion over many threads (OpenMP)
* Add SSE4.1 version of routines which use blending (up/down sampling for 
  instance)
* Some other things I cant think of.
