== Hardware platforms ==
PixFC-SSE has been tested on Windows, Linux and Mac OSX on the following platforms:
 * [http://pixfc-sse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/perf-results/i5-details.txt Intel Core i5 760 2.8 GHz]
 * [http://pixfc-sse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/perf-results/xeon-details.txt Quad core Xeon W3520 2.67 GHz]

== Conversion timings ==
The current list of supported conversions and timing information for each OS / platform can be found here:

|| OS || CPU || link ||
|| Linux || i5 || http://pixfc-sse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/perf-results/i5-linux.txt ||
|| Linux || Xeon || http://pixfc-sse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/perf-results/xeon-linux.txt ||
|| OSX || Xeon ||  http://pixfc-sse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/perf-results/xeon-osx.txt ||
|| Windows  || i5 || http://pixfc-sse.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/perf-results/i5-win7.txt ||

The above pages show the average conversion time in milliseconds, obtained by running each conversion 100 times with a different 1920x1080 input buffer each time. The average time spent in user-space, kernel space and the total number of context switches are also mentioned.
