In short, this is what you have to do:
 * [HowToUse#Download_PixFC Download PixFC]
 * [HowToUse#Build_PixFC Build PixFC]
 * [HowTouse#Include_PixFC_in_your_project Include PixFC in your project]
 
= Download PixFC=

Grab the stable release from the [http://code.google.com/p/pixfc-sse/downloads/list Downloads] tab and unpack it, or get the latest version from Subversion (check the [http://code.google.com/p/pixfc-sse/source/checkout Source] tab for instructions).

* Make sure you install [http://www.cmake.org CMake] before continuing. *

= Build PixFC=

Follow the instructions for your platform / environment. These will help you compile the PixFC library for a specific target platform or the one you will compile PixFC on.

== Windows - Visual Studio solution ==

Run a command prompt and change to the PixFC directory you downloaded in the previous step.

Then run either of the following command depending on whether you want to compile PixFC in 32- or 64-bit mode:
{{{
cmake -G "Visual Studio 10"
}}}
or
{{{
cmake -G "Visual Studio 10 Win64"
}}}
This will generate a Microsoft Visual Studio 10 solution (`pixfc-sse.sln`). Open it in Visual Studio. Select either Debug or Release configuration and build the solution.

The PixFC library (`libpixfc-sse.lib`) can then be found in the debug or release directory.

== Mac & Linux - Makefile ==

In a terminal, change to the PixFC directory and run the following commands:
{{{
cmake .
make
}}}

This will build PixFC library (`libpixfc-sse.a`) in the current directory.

== All Platforms - Eclipse CDT 4 ==

From a terminal / command prompt, change to the PixFC directory and run:
{{{
cmake -G "Eclipse CDT 4 - Unix Makefiles"
}}}
Then, open Eclipse and import the project located in the current directory, and build the library.

= Include PixFC in your project =

Copy the PixFC library (built in the previous step) as well as the API header file (`pixfc-sse.h`) into your project's directory.

The only thing left is to include `pixfc-sse.h` where appropriate (so you can call PixFC functions), and link your project to the PixFC library. On Linux, you must also link your application to librt with by passing `-lrt` to the linker.
