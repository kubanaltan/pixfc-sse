PixFC-SSE is a cross platform C library which provides SSE-optimised functions
to perform pixel format conversions efficiently.

You provide the input / output buffers and formats, PixFC-SSE selects the best 
conversion function to use based on the features supported by your CPU. In the 
worst case scenario, PixFC-SSE falls back to a standard, non-SSE optimised 
conversion function if the CPU has no SSE features. This way, PixFC-SSE 
guarantees the conversion will always happen.


The latest version of PixFC-SSE can be found at

== USAGE ==
PixFC comes with a simple command-line app (time_conversions) to quickly test 
how fast it performs on a machine.

Using PixFC in your own application is simple:
- you first build PixFC as a static library (or download a binary package 
  containing a pre-compiled PixFC static library from the website),
- update your application to use the conversion functions in PixFC and,
- link the PixFC static library to your application.

Please refer to the PixFC wiki at http://pixfc-sse.googlecode.com for the
latest instructions on how to :
- build PixFC from source,
- test PixFC's performance
- include PixFC in your application.
